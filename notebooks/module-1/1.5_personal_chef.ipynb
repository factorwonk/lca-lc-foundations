      "Nice! Leftover chicken and rice are a perfect base for a bunch of tasty meals. Here are some quick ideas you can try, plus a note on what you’d need to add if you want to pull them from a specific recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Chicken Fried Rice\n",
      "- What it is: A fast, skillet-cooked dish that revives both chicken and rice with soy sauce, a little sesame oil, and eggs.\n",
      "- Quick version: Sauté onion/garlic, push aside; scramble a couple eggs, mix in shredded chicken and cold rice, add peas/carrots, splash soy sauce and a drizzle of sesame oil. Top with green onions.\n",
      "- Time: about 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) One-Pot Chicken and Rice\n",
      "- What it is: A comforting, all-in-one skillet meal with chicken, rice, and stock.\n",
      "- Quick version: Sauté onion/garlic, stir in rice and broth, simmer until just tender, then fold in shredded chicken and quick veggies (peas, carrots) for a few final minutes.\n",
      "- Time: 30–40 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Arroz Con Pollo (Latin-style chicken and rice)\n",
      "- What it is: A flavorful one-pan dish with rice, tomatoes, peppers, and spices.\n",
      "- Quick version: Brown chicken pieces (optional), sauté aromatics and bell peppers, add rice, stock, tomatoes, and spices (saffron, paprika, or jealousy-of-adobo seasoning); simmer until rice is tender and chicken is heated through; toss in peas at the end.\n",
      "- Time: 40 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Creamy Chicken and Rice Casserole\n",
      "- What it is: A cozy bake with chicken, rice, and a creamy cheese or soup-based sauce.\n",
      "- Quick version: Mix shredded chicken, cooked rice, cream of chicken soup (or a homemade cream sauce), a little milk, and cheese; bake until bubbly and golden.\n",
      "- Time: 40 minutes (plus bake time).\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Hearty Chicken and Rice Soup\n",
      "- What it is: A warming soup with chicken, rice, and veggies in a soothing broth.\n",
      "- Quick version: Start with onions, carrots, celery; add chicken stock and seasonings, simmer briefly; add shredded chicken and rice last so it doesn’t get mushy; finish with herbs.\n",
      "- Time: about 30–40 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Cheesy Chicken Rice Skillet (weeknight friendly)\n",
      "- What it is: A quick skillet bake with veggies and cheese.\n",
      "- Quick version: Sauté aromatics, mix in rice, add a little broth to loosen, fold in chicken and your favorite veggies, top with cheese and finish under a brief broil or lid-covered melt.\n",
      "- Time: ~25–35 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips to tailor to what you have:\n",
      "- Veggies: peas, carrots, corn, bell peppers, onions, garlic, green onions.\n",
      "- Flavor boosters: soy sauce, teriyaki, paprika, cumin, saffron (or turmeric as a budget-friendly stand-in), cream of chicken soup or a splash of cream/milk for casseroles.\n",
      "- Spices: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, chili flakes if you want heat.\n",
      "- Dairy/cheese: cream, cream cheese, shredded cheddar or mozzarella for casseroles or skillet melts.\n",
      "\n",
