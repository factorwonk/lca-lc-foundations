      "- Location: On the rim of Shackleton Crater, in the southern polar region, where sunlit peaks meet vast ice fields\n",
      "- Founding: Established early in the Lunar Commonwealth era as a political heartbeat and gateway to polar ice and solar resources\n",
      "- Government: Capital district houses the Crown Council and the Prime Archivist; the Lunar Commonwealth’s central governance unfolds in the Crown Hall\n",
      "- Population: Roughly 12 million residents, plus researchers, traders, and transit crews\n",
      "- Districts:\n",
      "  - Crystal City: glassy towers that refract sunlight into dappled rainbows inside courtyards\n",
      "  - Lantern Quarter: markets lit by bioluminescent flora and adaptive polymer lanterns\n",
      "  - Iceheart District: housing carved from dark basalt and ice, with laboratories inside chilled caverns\n",
      "  - Pole Station Row: research // observatory complexes perched near the rim for orbital and solar studies\n",
      "- Landmarks:\n",
      "  - Crown Hall: impenetrable, spiraling pillar of basalt and lattice glass where the Council meets\n",
      "  - Aurora Spire: a needle of solar-harvesting infrastructure that glows at dusk\n",
      "  - Lumen Market: a vast trade hub trading water, isotopes, minerals, and ideas\n",
      "  - Pole Observatory Dome: a crystal dome peering into the universe\n",
      "- Economy: Water and volatiles mined from shadowed craters, solar energy farms feeding the planet and ships, biotech and materials manufacturing in pressurized domes\n",
      "- Transportation: Sunlit transit tubes and maglev sledways; a network of elevator-towers lifting goods and people to orbital trade lanes\n",
      "- Culture: A fusion of Arctic-minimalist aesthetics and vibrant amber-lit festivals; a calendar of polar-light ceremonies, holo-sculpting in ice, and the Night Market that appears with the first long night\n",
      "- Daily life flavor: In the long polar day, glassy corridors glow with reflected sun; when night falls, bioluminescent gardens pulse in the streets; residents wear adaptive fabrics that harvest energy and regulate temperature\n",

A Lunar Commonwealth emissary lays a map of gleaming ice along the table, while a trader from the Lumen Market slides a small cube of frozen water with a perfect internal glow to seal a deal. The room hums with the soft music of solar beacons outside, and the city’s glass skins flare like a heartbeat against the cold of space.\n",
